# HackYeah-PhilipMorris-2019

We were on HackYeah 2019 at Warsaw in Polland. This a competition where you can pick up a task from a company and you got 24 hours to complete it. Here is our project.

## Concept

The concept is about a campaign to motivate people to collect the cigarette stubs instead of throwing them away.
